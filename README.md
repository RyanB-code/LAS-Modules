## Shooter Central
To use the build scripts located in `build/scripts`, you need to update the `las-directory.dat` file with the proper LAS directory location. 

The path must include a slash at the end.

To not commit changes to the repository, tell git to ignore changes doing the following:

```
git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file
```
