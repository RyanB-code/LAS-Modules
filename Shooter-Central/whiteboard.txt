OPTIMIZE
---------------
  1. Use Iterators instead of copying for selected items for list
      - especially for GunTrackingAmmoUsed in View::eventsTab() items (lots of copying)
  2. Make SelectableGunMetadata with reset(), operator== compare to empty, for ease of use with UI  
  3. Prevent double adding of items for event. make buffer just be a shooting event
  
  4. Change window sizing for add_Event_GunsUsed tab since it /4 twice 
  5. Fix popup close() command
  6. fix changing Home::stockpileWindow() view more information command to change to view
  7. make separaor text for event add gus screen
